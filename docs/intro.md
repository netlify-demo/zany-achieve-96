Welcome to the Netlify Developer Documentation Template! This is a <a
href='https://docusaurus.io' target='_blank'>Docusaurus</a> site that was
created just for you. It looks like a normal developer documentation website,
but since itâ€™s deployed to <a href='https://netlify.com'
target='_blank'>Netlify</a>, it has some special features.



## Direct-to-CDN Deployment

  <div class='icon-text__text'>This site is deployed directly to a CDN. Skip
  the server, forget about managing infrastructure, and never worry about
  scaling up your website again.</div>

</div>

## Continous Deployment

  <div class='icon-text__text'>Developer docs change a lot, so being able to
  publish easily and often is important. Netlify takes care of all the
  complicated deployment configuration for you. All you have to do is edit a
  text file and push a Git commit to trigger a deploy.</div>

## Branch Builds


<div class='icon-text'>
  <img class='icon-text__icon' src='/docs/assets/feature-branches-small.svg'/>

  <div class='icon-text__text'>Maintaining a public code base inevitably leads
  to maintaining multiple versions of your developer documentation. Netlify
  makes this easy by letting you publishing individual Git branches to
  dedicated subdomains.</div>

</div>

<a class='button' href='/docs/edit-a-page'>Publish a new version of these docs</a>



## Built-In Collaboration


<div class='icon-text'>
  <img class='icon-text__icon' src='/docs/assets/feature-collaboration-small.svg'/>

  <div class='icon-text__text'>Anybody that can push to the underlying Git repo
  can publish changes to this website. Onboarding new developers is as easy as
  granting them access to a Git repository.</div>
