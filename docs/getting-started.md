This Docusaurus project lives in a Git repo that was created just for you, and
you’ve already been added to it as a collaborator. To start experimenting with
this site, you just have to grab the Git repo and install dependencies.


## Step 1: Clone the Git Repo

First, clone the Git repo that contains the source code for this Docusaurus
site:

    git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/some-random-repo-name.git
    cd some-random-repo-name

If you created this site through the <a href='https://netlify.com'
target='_blank'>Netlify demo generator</a> and supplied your GitHub username,
you’ve already been added as a collaborator to the above repo. [TODO: If not,
fork the official template repo.]


## Step 2: Install Dependencies and Build the Site

Then run the following commands to build a local copy of the website:

    npm install
    npm start
  
You should now be able to navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view
the site.


## Next Steps

That’s it! You’re up and running. We’re ready to [make some
edits](/docs/edit-a-page).


### Additional Resources

This project follows the conventions of the Docusaurus starter project, so
you’ll find all of the <a href='https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation'
target='_blank'>official documentation</a> useful if you’re not familiar with
Docusaurus.
