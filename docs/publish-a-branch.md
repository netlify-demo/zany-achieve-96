By default, Netlify only auto-deploys your `master` branch, but you can enable
branch builds to auto-deploy *any* branch in your Git repository. Branch builds
are particularly useful for creating staging environments to test changes
before they go live, as well as for maintaining multiple versions of your
documentation.

On this page, we’ll see how easy it is to use branch builds to maintain
separate v1.0 and v2.0 versions of this Docusaurus website.



## Step 1: Create a Local v2.0 Branch

First, we need to. Remember, this isn’t a feature branch-it’s a permanent
branch that will always be thhe new how to our v2.0 docs.




## Step 2: Enable Netlify Branch Builds

In the Netlify admin....




## Step 3: Push the v2.0 Branch

Now this works just like the `master` branch, except .....v2.0? master? v1.0?
