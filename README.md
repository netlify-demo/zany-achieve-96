Netlify Dev Docs Template
=========================

This is a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) project containing the "developer
documentation template" for Netlify demonstration purposes.



Setting Up
==========

Clone this repo and `cd` into the project. Then:

    cd website
    npm install
    npm start

You should have a working site at localhost:3000.



Contributing
============

This is still in a pretty rough state, so I'm not picky about how we edit
stuff. Feel free to edit directly on `master` and skip the pull requests for
the time being.
